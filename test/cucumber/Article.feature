Feature: journal article
  As a member of a research group
  I want to add, remove and modify journal articles I have published
  so that I can generate web pages and reports containing these articles

  Scenario: new article
    Given the system has no article entitled "A theory of software product line refinement"
    When I create the article "A theory of software product line refinement" with file name "TCS.pdf"
    Then the article "A theory of software product line refinement" is properly stored by the system

  Scenario: new invalid article (number field blank)
    Given the system has no article entitled "Algebraic reasoning for object-oriented programming"
    When I create the article "Algebraic reasoning for object-oriented programming" with file name "SCP.pdf" with the "number" field blank
    Then the article "Algebraic reasoning for object-oriented programming" is not stored by the system because it is invalid

  Scenario: duplicate article
    Given the system has article entitled "A theory of software product line refinement" with file name "TCS-0.pdf"
    When I create the article "A theory of software product line refinement" with file name "TCS-1.pdf"
    Then the article "A theory of software product line refinement" is not stored twice

  Scenario: alternative duplicate article
    Given the system has no article entitled "A theory of software product line refinement"
    When I create the article "A theory of software product line refinement" with file name "TCS-2"
    And I create the article "A theory of software product line refinement" with file name "TCS-3"
    Then the article "A theory of software product line refinement" is not stored twice

  Scenario: new article web
    Given I am at the publications menu
    When I select the "Periodico" option at the publications menu
    And I select the new article option at the article page
    Then I can fill the article details

  Scenario: remove existing article
    Given the system has article entitled "A theory of software product line refinement" with file name "TCS-44.pdf"
    When I delete the article "A theory of software product line refinement"
    Then the article "A theory of software product line refinement" is properly removed by the system

  Scenario: list existing article
    Given the system has article entitled "A theory of software product line refinement" with file name "TCS-55.pdf"
    When I view the article list
    Then my article list contains "A theory of software product line refinement"

  Scenario: edit existing article
    Given the system has article entitled "A theory of software product line refinement" with file name "TCS-66.pdf"
    When I edit the article title from "A theory of software product line refinement" to "A theory of software product line refinement REVIEWED"
    Then the article "A theory of software product line refinement" is properly updated by the system

  Scenario: remove existing article web
    Given I am at the articles page and the article "A theory of software product line refinement" is stored in the system with file name "TCS-77.pdf"
    When I select to view "A theory of software product line refinement" in resulting list
    And I select the option to remove in show page
    Then the article "A theory of software product line refinement" is properly removed by the system

  Scenario: list existing article web
    Given I am at the articles page and the article "A theory of software product line refinement" is stored in the system with file name "TCS-88.pdf"
    Then my resulting articles list contains "A theory of software product line refinement"

  Scenario: edit existing article web
    Given I am at the articles page and the article "A theory of software product line refinement" is stored in the system with file name "TCS-99.pdf"
    When I select to view "A theory of software product line refinement" in resulting list
    And I change the article title to "REVIEWED"
    And I select the "Alterar" option in Article Show Page
    Then I am at Article show page

  
  Scenario: Add a new article tweeting it
    Given I am logged as "admin"
    And I am at the Article Page
    When I try to create an article named as "A theory of software product line refinement 1" with filename "TCS-101.pdf"
    And I click on Share it in Twitter with "rgms_ufpe" and "rgmsadmin2013"
    Then A tweet is added to my twitter account regarding the new article "A theory of software product line refinement 1"

  Scenario: Add a new article and try to tweet the article using wrong login and password 
    Given I am logged as "admin"
    And I am at the Article Page
    When I try to create an article named as "Teoria de Sw" with filename "TCS-102.pdf"
    And I click on Share it in Twitter with "fake" and "fake2013"
    Then No tweet should be post about "Teoria de Sw"

  Scenario: Add a new article with twitter, but don't tweet it
    Given I am logged as "admin"
    And I am at the Article Page
    When I try to create an article named as "Empirical Studies in Product Line 2" with filename "TCS.pdf"
    Then No tweet should be post about "Empirical Studies in Product Line 2"
