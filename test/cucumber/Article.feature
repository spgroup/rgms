Feature: journal article
  As a member of a research group
  I want to add, remove and modify journal articles I have published
  so that I can generate web pages and reports containing these articles

  Scenario: new article
    Given the system has no article entitled "A theory of software product line refinement"
    When I create the article "A theory of software product line refinement" with file name "TCS.pdf"
    Then the article "A theory of software product line refinement" is properly stored by the system
