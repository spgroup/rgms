Feature: orientations
  As a admin of the system
  I want to add, remove and modify orientations I coached
  so that I can generate web pages and reports containing these orientations

  Scenario: new orientation
    Given the system has no orientations entitled "The Book is on the table"
    When I create a new orientation entitled "The Book is on the table"
    Then the orientation "The Book is on the table" is properly stored by the system

  Scenario: remove existing orientation
    Given   the system has an orientation entitled "The Book is on the table" supervised by someone
    When    I delete the orientation for "The Book is on the table"
    Then    the orientation for "The Book is on the table" is properly removed by the system

  Scenario: create orientation web
    Given I am at the create orientation page
    When I fill the orientation title with "The Book of Web Software"
    Then the orientation "The Book of Web Software" is properly stored by the system

  Scenario: edit existing orientation web
    Given I am at the orientation page
    And the orientation "The Book of Software Engineering" is stored in the system
    When I select to view orientation "The Book of Software Engineering" in resulting list
    And I change the orientation title to "Hexa"
    And I select the change option at the orientation edit page
    Then the edited orientation "Hexa" is properly stored by the system
