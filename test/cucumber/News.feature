    Given the research group "SPG" in the system has no Twitter account associated
    When I associate the account "@HumanBrainProj" to "SPG" group
    Then "SPG" research group has a twitter account "@HumanBrainProj" registered
    #Then the news can be retrieved by a Twitter post with "@testetwitteracount"

    Given the research group "SPG" in the system has a Twitter account "@HumanBrainProj" associated
    And   twitter account associated with "SPG" research group has been updated once
    When  I request to update the news from Twitter to research group "SPG"
